# Compatibility Unit Tests
Validation compatibility library for comparing GraphQL implementations unit tests results.

## Quick Start

Running the library:

```bash
$ ./bin/start.sh

```

```bash
(â€¢) https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql

```

## Validation Compatibility 

The library validates compatibility by checking the end results of the unit tests from the choosen graphql implementation
against the `graphql-js` implementation, the following checks are done:

The strategy works in the following steps:

1- Pulls the tests names of the JavaScript implementation, Eg:
```
describe('Execute: Handles execution with a complex schema', () => {
  it('executes using a schema', () => {
    // ...
  }
}
```

The name is converted to Go test name in the following syntax:
```
ExecuteHandlesExecutionWithAComplexSchema_ExecutesUsingASchema
```

### Details

1- `extractor-js`: Pulls the tests names from the **JavaScript GraphQL reference implementation**.

2- `extractor-js`: Formats and saves the tests names into a file named: **unit-tests.txt**.

3- `compatibility-unit-tests/extractor`: Pulls the tests names from **a GraphQL implementation, eg. Golang**.

4- `compatibility-unit-tests/validator`: Compares the tests names from the **JavaScript GraphQL reference implementation** using **unit-tests.txt** against the **GraphQL implementation, eg. Golang**.


### Further Work

There are multiple **GraphQL implementations** in different languages such in Golang: 
- https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen
- https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go

Current work covers compatibility validation in terms of checking tests names mapping, but this could be extended into including the **body and result** of each test and increasing the comparison so could be used for checking the compatibility with other implementations in deeper checks.
