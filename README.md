```

## Validation Compatibility 

The library validates compatibility by checking the end results of the unit tests from the choosen graphql implementation
against the `graphql-js` implementation, the following checks are done:

The strategy works in the following steps:

1- Pulls the tests names of the JavaScript implementation, Eg:
```
describe('Execute: Handles execution with a complex schema', () => {
  it('executes using a schema', () => {
    // ...
  }
}
```

The name is converted to Go test name in the following syntax:
```
ExecuteHandlesExecutionWithAComplexSchema_ExecutesUsingASchema
```

### Details

1- Extractor: Pulls the JavaScript names from the unit tests.
