# Compatibility Unit Tests
Validation compatibility library for comparing GraphQL implementations unit tests results.

## Quick Start

Running the library:

```bash
$ ./bin/start.sh

```

```bash

```

## Validation Compatibility 

The library validates compatibility by checking the end results of the unit tests from the choosen graphql implementation
against the `graphql-js` implementation, the following checks are done:

The strategy works in the following steps:

1- Pulls the tests names of the JavaScript implementation, Eg:
```
describe('Execute: Handles execution with a complex schema', () => {
  it('executes using a schema', () => {
    // ...
  }
}
```

The name is converted to Go test name in the following syntax:
```
ExecuteHandlesExecutionWithAComplexSchema_ExecutesUsingASchema
```

### Details

1- `extractor-js`: Pulls the JavaScript tests names from the unit tests files.
2- `extractor-js`: Saves the unit tests names into a file named: `unit-tests.txt`.
3- `compatibility-unit-tests/extractor`: Pulls the unit tests names from the GraphQL implementation.
4- `compatibility-unit-tests/validator`: Compares the unit tests names from the GraphQL implementation against the `unit-tests.txt` file.
